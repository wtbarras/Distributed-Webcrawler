When make is called, all the in/out files under the nodes are removed so that
they aren't appended to in the next run


Only works on lists of 8 machines.
The URL supplied to this crawler must match one in the config file
	Note on this: The URLs in the config file may be redirected, which would result in
	 the top directory not matching any of the nodes. For instance cs.colostate.edu/cstop/index.html
	 redirects to ..../index.php. So the top directory is ....-index.html, but it contains
	 no directory under nodes/ that matches that.


I truncate anything after a '#' because that's a link to a position on a page.
